# Comparing Regression Specifications: Cluster ID, Combined Score, and Interaction Term

## 1. Full Model: All Components Included
**Specification**:
\[
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_{\text{Cluster}} \cdot \text{Cluster ID} + \beta_{\text{Score}} \cdot \text{Combined Score} + \gamma \cdot (\text{Cluster ID} \cdot \text{Combined Score}) + \epsilon
\]

- **Cluster ID**: Captures baseline differences across clusters.
- **Combined Score**: Captures the overall effect of the anomaly score.
- **Interaction Term**: Captures how the relationship between the combined score and \( Y \) varies by cluster.

**Best Practice**: This is the most complete and interpretable model, as it preserves all main and interaction effects.

## 2. Exclude the Combined Score
**Specification**:
\[
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_{\text{Cluster}} \cdot \text{Cluster ID} + \gamma \cdot (\text{Cluster ID} \cdot \text{Combined Score}) + \epsilon
\]

- **What Happens**:
  - The effect of the combined score is absorbed into the interaction term.
  - The baseline effect of the combined score is lost, making the interpretation of interaction terms more complex.

---

## 3. Exclude the Cluster ID
**Specification**:
\[
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_{\text{Score}} \cdot \text{Combined Score} + \gamma \cdot (\text{Cluster ID} \cdot \text{Combined Score}) + \epsilon
\]

- **What Happens**:
  - Baseline differences between clusters are not accounted for.
  - The interaction terms partially absorb cluster effects, making them harder to interpret.

---

## 4. Exclude the Interaction Term
**Specification**:
\[
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_{\text{Cluster}} \cdot \text{Cluster ID} + \beta_{\text{Score}} \cdot \text{Combined Score} + \epsilon
\]

- **What Happens**:
  - Assumes the combined score affects \( Y \) in the **same way across all clusters**.
  - Loses flexibility to account for cluster-specific effects of the combined score.
